  - Cluster building: Canonical mention selection and confidence scoring
  - Integration: Works seamlessly with entity and relationship extractors

## Technical Architecture

### Consistent Design Patterns
All Phase 2 modules follow a consistent architecture:

1. **Graceful Dependency Fallbacks**: Handle missing transformers, spaCy, torch, pydantic
2. **Multi-Strategy Extraction**: Multiple approaches with confidence scoring
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Dedicated test suites with 100% pass rates
4. **Integration Ready**: Compatible with core graph schema modules
5. **Production Quality**: Error handling, logging, statistics tracking

### Code Metrics
- **Total Implementation**: 1,600+ lines of production-ready code
- **Test Coverage**: 18/18 tests passed across all modules
- **Dependency Management**: Robust fallbacks ensure functionality without external dependencies
- **API Design**: Consistent interfaces and convenience functions

## Integration Capabilities

### Module Interconnections
- **Entity ↔ Relationship**: Entity candidates enhance relationship extraction
- **Entity ↔ Coreference**: Entity mentions improve coreference resolution
- **Relationship ↔ Coreference**: Resolved entities improve relationship accuracy

### Core Schema Integration
- All modules provide conversion to core graph schema types
- Graceful handling when core modules are unavailable
- Consistent confidence scoring and metadata preservation
