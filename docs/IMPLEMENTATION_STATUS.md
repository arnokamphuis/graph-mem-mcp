# Knowledge Graph Refactoring Implementation Status

## Summary

Based on the analysis of your current knowledge graph implementation and industry best practices, I have created a comprehensive refactoring plan and begun implementation of the improved system. The current implementation has good foundations but lacks several critical components for building high-quality knowledge graphs.

## Analysis Completed

### Current Implementation Assessment
‚úÖ **Strengths Identified:**
- Modern NLP with spaCy for NER and dependency parsing
- Sentence transformers for semantic embeddings
- Semantic clustering with DBSCAN algorithm
- Domain-specific concept extraction
- Confidence and importance scoring mechanisms

‚ùå **Critical Weaknesses Found:**
- Limited entity linking and coreference resolution
- No clear schema definition or ontology management
- Pattern-based relationship extraction (not sophisticated enough)
- No graph reasoning and inference capabilities
- Missing multi-hop relationship discovery
- Limited temporal information handling
- No entity disambiguation strategy
- Missing graph quality assessment framework
