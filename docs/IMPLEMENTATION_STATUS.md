# Knowledge Graph Refactoring Implementation Status

## Summary

Based on the analysis of your current knowledge graph implementation and industry best practices, I have created a comprehensive refactoring plan and begun implementation of the improved system. The current implementation has good foundations but lacks several critical components for building high-quality knowledge graphs.

## Analysis Completed

### Current Implementation Assessment
✅ **Strengths Identified:**
- Modern NLP with spaCy for NER and dependency parsing
- Sentence transformers for semantic embeddings
- Semantic clustering with DBSCAN algorithm
- Domain-specific concept extraction
- Confidence and importance scoring mechanisms

❌ **Critical Weaknesses Found:**
- Limited entity linking and coreference resolution
- No clear schema definition or ontology management
- Pattern-based relationship extraction (not sophisticated enough)
- No graph reasoning and inference capabilities
- Missing multi-hop relationship discovery
- Limited temporal information handling
- No entity disambiguation strategy
- Missing graph quality assessment framework

## Implementation Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Architecture - PARTIALLY COMPLETED

#### 1. Graph Schema Management - COMPLETED
**File:** `mcp_server/core/graph_schema.py`

**Implemented Features:**
- Complete entity type hierarchies with inheritance
- Relationship type definitions with cardinality constraints
- Property schemas with data types and validation rules
- Namespace management for different domains
- Schema evolution and versioning support
- Comprehensive validation for entities and relationships
- JSON serialization for schema persistence

**Key Classes:**
- `EntityTypeSchema` - Defines entity types with properties
- `RelationshipTypeSchema` - Defines relationship types with constraints  
- `GraphSchema` - Complete schema container
- `SchemaManager` - Main interface for schema operations
- `EntityInstance`/`RelationshipInstance` - Runtime entity instances

#### 2. Advanced Entity Resolution - COMPLETED
**File:** `mcp_server/core/entity_resolution.py`

**Implemented Features:**
- Fuzzy string matching with intelligent normalization
- Embedding-based semantic similarity (when transformers available)
- Comprehensive alias extraction and acronym generation
- Graph-based entity clustering using connected components
- Sophisticated entity merging with conflict resolution
- Multi-strategy matching (exact, fuzzy, semantic, alias)
- Statistics and monitoring for resolution quality

**Key Classes:**
- `EntityCandidate` - Entity for resolution processing
- `EntityMatch` - Match result with evidence
- `EntityCluster` - Resolved entity clusters
- `EntityResolver` - Main resolution engine

#### 3. Graph Analytics Foundation - COMPLETED ✅
**File:** `mcp_server/core/graph_analytics.py`

**Implemented Features:**
- NetworkX integration for advanced graph operations
- Shortest path algorithms (single and multiple paths)
- PageRank and centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness)
- Community detection with multiple algorithms (Louvain, spectral, connected components)
- Subgraph extraction and neighborhood analysis
- Graph density and connectivity metrics
- Comprehensive analytics summary generation
- Graceful fallbacks for missing optional dependencies

**Key Classes:**
- `GraphNode` - Enhanced node representation with centrality scores
- `GraphEdge` - Weighted edges with confidence and relationship types
- `PathResult` - Comprehensive path analysis results
- `Community` - Detected community structures with metrics
- `GraphAnalytics` - Main analytics engine with NetworkX integration

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Ready for testing and integration
