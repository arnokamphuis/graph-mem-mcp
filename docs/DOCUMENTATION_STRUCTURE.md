# Documentation Structure Summary

## Overview

The knowledge graph refactoring project documentation has been properly organized with clear separation between agent instructions and implementation details.

## Documentation Structure

### `.github/prompts/`
- **`knowledge-graph-refactoring-implementation.md`** - GitHub Copilot agent behavior instructions
  - Focuses on workflow protocol and progress tracking requirements
  - References detailed plans in `/docs/` directory
  - Emphasizes documentation discipline and quality gates

### `/docs/` 
- **`REFACTORING_PLAN.md`** - Complete implementation roadmap (moved from root)
  - 6-week implementation phases
  - File structure specifications
  - Technology stack requirements
  - Success metrics and risk assessment

- **`IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`** - Current progress tracking (moved from root)
  - Phase completion status
  - Next tasks and blockers
  - Quality improvements achieved
  - Migration strategy progress

- **`CODING_STANDARDS.md`** - Code quality requirements (new)
  - Dependency management patterns
  - Error handling standards
  - Testing requirements
  - Type safety guidelines
  - Documentation standards

## Agent Workflow

The GitHub Copilot agent is now configured to:

1. **Read documentation first** - Always check `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` before starting work
2. **Follow established patterns** - Reference existing code in `/mcp_server/core/` for consistency
3. **Track progress meticulously** - Update status documentation with every significant change
4. **Maintain quality standards** - Follow patterns defined in `/docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md`
5. **Document decisions** - Record all design choices and rationale in appropriate docs

## Benefits of This Structure

### For Developers
- Clear separation between "what to build" (docs) and "how to behave" (prompts)
- Easy to find current status and next tasks
- Consistent code quality standards
- Progress tracking prevents duplicate work

### For GitHub Copilot
- Focused agent instructions without implementation noise
- Clear references to detailed documentation
- Emphasis on progress tracking and quality maintenance
- Structured workflow protocol

### For Project Management
- Centralized progress tracking in `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- Clear visibility into current phase and next tasks
- Quality metrics and success measurement
- Risk tracking and mitigation strategies

## Usage Instructions

### For Contributors
1. Start by reading `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
2. Reference `/docs/REFACTORING_PLAN.md` for context
3. Follow patterns in `/docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md`
4. Update status documentation with all changes

### For Project Management
1. Monitor progress via `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
2. Review quality metrics against targets in `/docs/REFACTORING_PLAN.md`
3. Track risks and blockers in status documentation
4. Approve plan changes through documentation updates

This structure ensures systematic implementation while maintaining comprehensive progress tracking and quality standards.
