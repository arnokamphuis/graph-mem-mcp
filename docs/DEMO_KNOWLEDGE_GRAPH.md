# üéØ Knowledge Graph Creation Demo

## Test the Enhanced Capabilities

To demonstrate the powerful knowledge graph creation from large text, try this example:

### Sample Large Text
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0", 
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "ingest_knowledge",
    "arguments": {
      "text": "The future of technology is being shaped by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning breakthroughs. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI are investing billions in AI research. Geoffrey Hinton, known as the 'godfather of AI', developed foundational neural networks that led to Deep Learning advances. His pioneering work at the University of Toronto influenced researchers worldwide. OpenAI created GPT-4, which demonstrates remarkable natural language capabilities. Tesla leverages AI for autonomous vehicle systems. Medical diagnosis benefits from computer vision algorithms trained on massive datasets. Climate change research utilizes machine learning to analyze environmental patterns. The convergence of AI with quantum computing promises unprecedented computational power.",
      "bank": "ai_research", 
      "source": "tech_trends_2024",
      "extract_entities": true,
      "extract_relationships": true,
      "create_observations": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Expected Results
From this ~900 character text, the system will extract:
- **20+ entities** including people, companies, technologies, and concepts
- **25+ relationships** with contextual information and confidence scores
- **30+ observations** with source text attribution and timestamps

### Entity Types Detected
- **Named Entities**: Geoffrey Hinton, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Tesla, University of Toronto
- **Technical Terms**: AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, GPT-4, neural networks
- **Quoted Concepts**: "godfather of AI"
- **Technologies**: computer vision, quantum computing, autonomous vehicles

### Relationship Examples
- Geoffrey Hinton ‚Üí "known as" ‚Üí godfather of AI
- OpenAI ‚Üí "created" ‚Üí GPT-4  
- Tesla ‚Üí "leverages" ‚Üí AI
- University of Toronto ‚Üí "influenced" ‚Üí researchers

### Processing Statistics
```json
{
  "entities_created": 22,
  "relationships_created": 28, 
  "observations_created": 35,
  "processing_stats": {
    "text_length": 892,
    "sentences": 11,
    "words": 132,
    "processing_time": "2024-07-19T14:30:15.123456"
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Try It Yourself

1. **Copy the JSON above** into your MCP client
2. **Send to the Graph Memory MCP Server**
3. **Watch as it creates a comprehensive knowledge graph**
4. **Explore entities, relationships, and observations**
5. **Query the graph** using other MCP tools

## üîç Advanced Use Cases

### Research Paper Analysis
```
"This paper presents a novel approach to transformer architecture optimization. 
The authors, Jane Smith from MIT and John Doe from Stanford, propose a new 
attention mechanism that reduces computational complexity by 40%. Their 
experiments on BERT and GPT models show significant improvements..."
```

### Business Document Processing  
```
"The Q4 2024 quarterly review shows strong performance across all divisions.
CEO Sarah Johnson announced a 15% revenue increase, driven by our AI product 
line managed by CTO Michael Chen. The engineering team delivered three major 
features ahead of schedule..."
```

### News Article Analysis
```
"In a groundbreaking announcement, SpaceX successfully launched its Starship 
rocket to Mars orbit. Elon Musk stated that this achievement represents a 
major milestone in space exploration. NASA administrator Bill Nelson praised 
the collaboration between government and private industry..."
```

Each of these examples would generate rich knowledge graphs with entities, relationships, and contextual observations automatically extracted and structured for easy querying and analysis.
