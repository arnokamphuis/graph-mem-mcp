# Bank Switching Visualization Feature - Implementation Complete! üéâ

## ‚úÖ **FEATURE SUMMARY**

Successfully implemented **dynamic bank switching** in the Graph Memory MCP Server visualization interface, allowing users to seamlessly switch between different memory banks without page reloads.

## üöÄ **NEW CAPABILITIES**

### **1. Enhanced Visualization Interface**
- **Bank Selector Dropdown**: Prominently displayed in the controls section
- **Dynamic Bank Switching**: Switch between banks without page reload
- **Bank Statistics**: Shows entity and relationship counts for each bank
- **Visual Bank Indicator**: Current bank highlighted in the interface

### **2. Improved User Experience**
- **State Preservation**: Maintains search terms, layout settings, and zoom level when switching banks
- **Loading Indicators**: Shows progress during bank transitions
- **Browser History Support**: Back/forward buttons work correctly with bank switches
- **Enhanced Export**: PNG exports include bank name in filename

### **3. New Endpoints**
- **`/visualize`**: Main visualization interface with bank selection
- **Enhanced `/banks/{bank}/visualize`**: Now includes bank switching functionality
- **Existing `/visualizations`**: Lists all available banks and statistics

## üé® **INTERFACE ENHANCEMENTS**

### **Controls Section**
```html
Memory Bank: [dropdown with bank statistics] [üîÑ Refresh]
Search:      [search input field]
Layout:      [layout selector]
Actions:     [Fit] [Export PNG] [Refresh]
```

### **Visual Design**
- **Prominent Bank Selector**: Highlighted with special styling and border
- **Statistics Display**: Shows "(X entities, Y relations)" for each bank
- **Current Bank Indicator**: Visually emphasized in the header
- **Responsive Layout**: Works well on different screen sizes

## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Key JavaScript Functions**
- `loadAvailableBanks()`: Fetches and populates bank dropdown
- `switchToBank()`: Handles dynamic bank switching
- `initNetwork(bankName)`: Loads graph data for specified bank
- Enhanced state management for seamless transitions

### **Browser Integration**
- **History API**: Updates URL without page reload
- **Event Handling**: Supports browser back/forward navigation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing banks or data

### **State Preservation**
- Search terms maintained across bank switches
- Layout preferences preserved
- Zoom level and position maintained
- Export filename includes current bank name

## üìã **USAGE EXAMPLES**

### **Accessing the Enhanced Visualization**
```bash
# Main visualization interface (with bank switching)
http://localhost:10642/visualize

# Bank-specific interface (also includes bank switching)
http://localhost:10642/banks/default/visualize
http://localhost:10642/banks/project-alpha/visualize
http://localhost:10642/banks/client-demo-project/visualize
```

### **Managing Multiple Banks**
```bash
# Create new banks
curl -X POST http://localhost:10642/banks/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bank": "project-alpha"}'

# Add entities to specific banks
curl -X POST http://localhost:10642/banks/select \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bank": "project-alpha"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:10642/entities \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": "web-app", "data": {"type": "project"}}'
```

### **Visualization Features**
1. **Select Bank**: Use dropdown to choose memory bank
2. **View Statistics**: See entity/relationship counts
3. **Switch Seamlessly**: No page reload required
4. **Maintain Context**: Search and layout preserved
5. **Export with Context**: PNG files named by bank

## üéØ **USER WORKFLOW**

### **Typical Usage Pattern**
1. **Open Visualization**: Navigate to `/visualize` or `/banks/{bank}/visualize`
2. **Select Bank**: Choose from dropdown (shows statistics)
3. **Explore Graph**: Search, zoom, filter entities
4. **Switch Banks**: Select different bank from dropdown
5. **Continue Work**: Interface state preserved across switches
6. **Export Results**: Save bank-specific visualizations

### **Multi-Project Scenarios**
- **Software Development**: Switch between client projects
- **Research Work**: Navigate between different research topics
- **Data Analysis**: Compare different datasets or time periods
- **Knowledge Management**: Organize by domain or context

## üèÜ **BENEFITS**

### **For Users**
- **Efficiency**: No need to navigate to different URLs
- **Context Switching**: Easy comparison between projects
- **State Preservation**: Don't lose work when switching
- **Visual Clarity**: Always know which bank you're viewing

### **For Developers**
- **Better Organization**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Easier Debugging**: Quick switching between environments
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Seamless workflow across projects
- **Better Data Management**: Clear bank boundaries

### **For AI Agents**
- **Topic Isolation**: Clean separation prevents cross-contamination
- **Context Awareness**: Clear understanding of current bank
- **Enhanced Integration**: Better tool usage patterns
- **Improved Workflows**: More organized knowledge management

## üìä **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED**
- Bank selector dropdown with statistics
- Dynamic bank switching without page reload
- State preservation across switches
- Browser history integration
- Enhanced export functionality
- Visual design improvements
- Error handling and loading states
- Documentation and examples

### **‚úÖ TESTED**

## üéâ **CONCLUSION**

The bank switching feature transforms the Graph Memory MCP Server visualization from a single-bank viewer into a powerful multi-bank navigation interface. Users can now efficiently work with multiple knowledge graphs, maintaining context and state across transitions.

**Key Achievement**: Enhanced the visualization interface to support the core bank organization principle that's fundamental to the Graph Memory MCP architecture.
