# 🧠 Enhanced Knowledge Graph Creation

## Overview

The Graph Memory MCP Server now includes powerful **automated knowledge graph creation** from large texts! This transforms any document, article, or text into a structured knowledge graph with entities, relationships, and contextual observations.

## 🚀 New MCP Tool: `ingest_knowledge`

### Description
Create a comprehensive knowledge graph from large text with advanced entity and relationship extraction using sophisticated natural language processing patterns.

### Capabilities

#### 🔍 **Advanced Entity Extraction**
- **Named Entities**: Companies, people, technologies (Google, Geoffrey Hinton, AI)
- **Technical Terms**: CamelCase patterns (MachineLearning, DeepLearning)
- **Quoted Concepts**: Phrases in quotes ("godfather of AI", "autonomous driving")
- **Contact Information**: Email addresses and URLs
- **Measurements**: Numbers with units (5TB, $2B, 95%)
- **Dates**: Various formats (2024-07-19, July 19, 2024)

#### 🔗 **Intelligent Relationship Detection**
- **Action Relationships**: "OpenAI created GPT-4", "Tesla uses AI"
- **Categorical Relationships**: "Companies like Google", "known as godfather"
- **Temporal Relationships**: "led to breakthroughs", "resulted in advances"
- **Co-occurrence**: Entities mentioned together with contextual relevance

#### 📝 **Contextual Observations**
- **Source Attribution**: Every entity linked to original text context
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI-generated confidence levels for reliability
- **Timestamps**: Full audit trail of when knowledge was extracted
- **Context Snippets**: Surrounding text showing entity usage

## 🎯 Example Usage

### Input Text
```
"Artificial Intelligence represents one of the most transformative technologies. 
Companies like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI are leading AI research. Geoffrey 
Hinton, known as the 'godfather of AI', developed neural networks that led to 
Deep Learning breakthroughs. OpenAI created GPT-4, which demonstrates remarkable 
text generation capabilities."
```

### Generated Knowledge Graph
- **13 Entities** extracted with types and confidence scores
- **14 Relationships** with contextual information
- **17 Observations** with source text attribution

  "to": "godfather_of_ai", 
  "type": "known",
  "context": "Geoffrey Hinton, known as the 'godfather of AI', developed neural networks",
  "confidence": 0.6
}
```

### Sample Observations
```json
{
  "entity_id": "openai",
  "content": "Found in context: \"OpenAI created GPT-4, which demonstrates remarkable\"",
  "timestamp": "2024-07-19T14:07:50.817492"
}
```
