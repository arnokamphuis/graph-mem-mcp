# Semantic Relationship Enhancement Implementation

## Problem Addressed

The original knowledge graph implementation extracted only generic "related_to" relationships when ingesting large text, losing crucial semantic information about **how** entities are actually related.

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Relationship Extraction

The new `extract_relationships` function uses a multi-layered approach to extract meaningful semantic relationships:

#### 1. Pattern-Based Extraction
Uses regex patterns to identify common linguistic structures:

- **Hierarchical**: "X is a Y" → `is_type_of`
- **Possession**: "X has Y" → `has`
- **Creation**: "X created Y" → `created`
- **Usage**: "X uses Y" → `uses`
- **Implementation**: "X implements Y" → `implements`
- **Location**: "X in Y" → `located_in`

#### 2. Contextual Analysis
Analyzes connecting words between entities:

- **Action Verbs**: manages, leads, supports, controls, monitors
- **Prepositions**: with → `associated_with`, by → `performed_by`

#### 3. Domain-Specific Inference
Based on entity types, infers appropriate relationships:

- **Person + Organization** → `works_for`
- **Technical Term + Technical Term** → `depends_on`
- **Date + Entity** → `occurred_on`

### Relationship Taxonomy

The implementation supports the following semantic relationship categories:

- **Hierarchical**: `is_type_of`, `instance_of`, `subclass_of`, `parent_of`
- **Possession**: `has`, `contains`, `includes`, `part_of`, `belongs_to`
- **Creation**: `created`, `created_by`, `authored_by`, `developed_by`
- **Usage**: `uses`, `used_by`, `depends_on`, `requires`
- **Implementation**: `implements`, `implemented_by`, `extends`
- **Organizational**: `works_for`, `employs`, `manages`, `reports_to`
- **Spatial**: `located_in`, `within`, `under`, `over`
- **Temporal**: `before`, `after`, `during`
- **Functional**: `processes`, `generates`, `transforms`, `controls`

### Confidence Scoring

Relationships are assigned confidence scores based on extraction method:

- **0.9**: Pattern-based matches (high confidence)
- **0.7**: Contextual analysis (medium confidence)  
- **0.5**: Domain inference (moderate confidence)
- **0.3**: Generic "related_to" fallback (low confidence)

## Example Improvements

### Before Enhancement
```json
{
  "from": "John Smith", 
  "to": "Microsoft",
  "type": "related_to",
  "confidence": 0.4
}
```

### After Enhancement
```json
{
  "from": "John Smith",
  "to": "Microsoft", 
  "type": "works_for",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "connecting_text": " is a software engineer at "
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Semantic Richness**: Knowledge graphs now capture meaningful relationship semantics
2. **Better Querying**: Can query for specific relationship types (e.g., "Who works for Microsoft?")
3. **Enhanced Reasoning**: AI agents can understand the nature of connections between entities
4. **Preserved Context**: Original sentence context is maintained for each relationship
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality remains intact

## Files Modified

- `mcp_server/main.py`: Enhanced `extract_relationships()` function
- `semantic_relationships_enhancement.py`: Standalone module with full implementation

## Testing

To test the enhancement, ingest text with diverse entity relationships and observe the semantic relationship types extracted instead of generic "related_to" connections.

This enhancement transforms the knowledge graph from a simple co-occurrence network into a semantically rich representation that preserves and leverages the meaning encoded in natural language text.
