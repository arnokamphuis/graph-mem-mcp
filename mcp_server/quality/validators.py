Graph Quality Assessment Framework - Core Validators

This module provides comprehensive quality assessment tools for knowledge graphs,
including entity completeness scoring, relationship accuracy metrics, graph
connectivity analysis, duplicate detection, and consistency validation.

Features:
- Entity completeness scoring
- Relationship accuracy metrics
- Graph connectivity analysis
- Duplicate detection and cleanup
- Consistency validation across relationships
- Quality report generation with actionable insights

Usage:
    from mcp_server.quality.validators import GraphQualityAssessment
    from mcp_server.core.graph_schema import SchemaManager
    
    # Initialize with graph store and schema
    quality_assessor = GraphQualityAssessment(graph_store, schema_manager)
    
    # Run comprehensive quality assessment
    quality_report = quality_assessor.assess_graph_quality()
    
    # Access specific quality metrics
    print(f"Overall Quality Score: {quality_report.overall_score:.2f}")
    print(f"Entity Completeness: {quality_report.completeness_score:.2f}")
    print(f"Relationship Accuracy: {quality_report.accuracy_score:.2f}")
